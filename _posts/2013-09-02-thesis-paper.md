Here's a [public link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7d1o8e1el2xnjkl/thesis.pdf) to my master thesis paper, available on Dropbox.

It's about scraping tons of train schedule HTML pages with PHP, IronMQ, Queue workers, Redis, MongoDB...
and trying to find out it would be possible to predict train delays. Spoiler: it's not possible.

Cheers!
