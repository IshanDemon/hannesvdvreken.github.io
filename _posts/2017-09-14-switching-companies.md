After precisely 3 years (since 8 September 2014) at [madewithlove](https://madewithlove.be), I've decided it was time to move on.
A little while ago, I agreed to join the team at [Stream](https://getstream.io) as a PHP Software Engineer and Developer Advocate.
Next Monday I will join them in their office in [TQ](https://tq.co/) in Amsterdam.

My job will be to represent them, and the product, in the PHP community.
Many people know Algolia, Sendgrid, Twilio, etc. I'll be creating demo applications, tutorials and workshops in PHP.
Also I'll be a point of contact (account manager if you will) for customers doing integrations with our product in PHP applications.
Next to that I will keep doing my best to create PHP related talks, that help other people learn new things.

I'm really looking forward to this new chapter and I'd like to thank my colleagues at madewithlove for the epic ride! Keep rocking.
