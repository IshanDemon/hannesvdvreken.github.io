I studied applied engineering and got my **Master in Science** degree in 2013.
Today I am a Web developer working for [madewithlove](http://mwl.be).
I try to practise my speaking skills at meetups and conferences
because I believe preparing a [slide deck](https://speakerdeck.com/hannesvdvreken)
is the best way to thoroughly get to know a subject.

Besides work I love to organise **meetups and conferences**.
I organise meetups for [MongoDB Belgium](http://www.meetup.com/mongodb-belgium/)
and grew a community of 340+ members so far. I also organised an occasional
[LaravelPHP summer meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Laravel-Brussels/events/189623102/) in July 2014.
Since then I also run the [php.gent](http://php.gent) meetup group.
In the past I have created [Ghendetta](http://ghendetta.be) together with some friends.
I also love to **contribute to open source projects** in PHP and a little bit of Node.js.

In the rest of my free time I like to spend with friends and family to eat and drink beers.
To keep in shape I like to do sports: wall/rock climbing and
[marathon running](http://www.strava.com/activities/284870685).
